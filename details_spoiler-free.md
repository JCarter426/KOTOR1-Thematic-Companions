# Thematic KOTOR Companions

## Carth

| Remove | Improved Two-Weapon Fighting |
| Add    | Implant Level 1              |

### Explanation
Your first main companion Carth’s setup is mostly consistent, save that the game doesn’t give him the attribute he’s due at level 4 and he has two feats that could only be selected at level 4 (Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Weapon Specialization: Blaster Pistol). To remedy this I’ve chosen to give him a basic feat instead, removing Improved Two-Weapon Fighting in exchange for Implant Level 1. While mechanically Toughness would be the most optimal perk, Carth isn’t a frontline fighter (or at least hadn’t been to this point), and logically I reason he should have some level of neural interface as a starship captain.

|-----|---------|
| CHA | 10 → 13 |

### Explanation
This character’s only problem was lacking base attributes they should have. They already have all the combat-related attributes I think they should for their age and experience, however, so the extra attributes are instead directed to CHA. They’re a bit of a smooth talker.

### Feats

|--------|-----------|
| Add    | Toughness |

### Explanation
This character’s statline is heavily inflated, but they are also not human, and due to some other mechanical restrictions based on their species, I consider their attribute setup part of a racial bonus: +2 STR/+2 CON.

Pulling their STR and CON down to 16 (18 with the assumed racial bonus factored) gets them to a normal statline for a level 4 scout, but one point of WIS is traded for DEX, for thematic consistency—this character is far from the brightest, to put it lightly.

They are also short one feat (they receive one racial-specific feat for free, but lose two other feats unusable for their race in exchange). I have chosen to spend this free feat on the mechanically optimal Toughness. This is somewhat offset, however, by bringing their base vitality down to where it should be, from 32 to 24; they’re already very strong, especially now coming with Toughness, and don’t need the additional vitality to make them viable, especially when their CON is already so high.

| Stealth      | 0 → 1 |
| Awareness    | 4 → 5 |
| Treat Injury | 4 → 5 |

### Explanation
This Jedi’s inflated attributes are pulled down to a standard position for a level 3 Sentinel, but in exchange they get some skill points they should’ve had at that level, but lacked.

TECHNICALLY they have one more power and feat than they should, but there are good reasons for that. The power is Affect Mind, which no companion can use (but which is given to them for consistency, for when they use it in dialogues); in Thematic KOTOR Companions the Jedi companions are left with Affect Mind, but it is not counted against their power total. The feat, meanwhile, is a unique story-related feat which narratively sets the companion apart, above someone else on their same level, and is thus treated as being a unique property of the character rather than a class oversight.

|-------------|-------|
| Demolitions | 1 → 3 |

### Explanation
This droid character’s stats are ludicrously overtuned, but they are also the least-used companion in the game; there’s no reason to make what is already the least-used companion used even less. To that end I have left them as-is, and indeed buffed their demolitions slightly, since with their currently insane 20 INT they should actually have had significantly more skill points. I have not invested the full amount they are due, though, so the player still has some measure of skill points to spend during level-ups.

|--------|----------------------|
| Remove | Improved Power Blast |
| Add    | Implant Level 1      |

### Explanation
This character is mostly fine, though they’re 2 attribute points short (3 counting their level 4 point which they’re not granted by the time they become a party member). I’ve made them stronger and tougher, to narratively match some later statements they make.

Additionally, this character’s Improved Power Blast has been swapped for Implant Lvl. 1, since the game establishes that they come with implants already. Doesn’t make sense for them to have no ability to use them when they already have them!

### Skills

|--------------|-------|
| Stealth      | 5 → 3 |
| Awareness    | 8 → 1 |
| Treat Injury | 8 → 2 |

### Explanation
This character, like all Jedi companions in KOTOR, is quite overtuned. To make up the attribute debt I’ve taken away a decent amount of their INT and WIS to represent some of the character’s inner turmoil. To slightly compensate for this, their CHA is increased with the remainder, giving them a +1 there.

Their stats have also been hit hard due to their INT reduction, but there is still potential here through level-ups, if the points are directed in the right way.

As with the earlier Jedi companion, after this rework this character still technically has one more feat than they should, but this feat is similarly a unique character-specific feat representing the character’s upbringing and how they use the Force. Since this is a unique feat which represents something the character already has, I have chosen not to count it against their feat total.

| Remove | Power Blast          |
| Add    | Sniper Shot          |
| Add    | Improved Sniper Shot |

### Explanation
This droid character has some structural issues, no pun intended. The biggest one is the most obvious: a droid that literally can’t use melee has 16 STR. 10 attribute points—9 if you’re being generous and counting the point they get at level 4—blown on an entirely useless attribute.

Now, droids are probably stronger than humans, and I don’t think it’s logically consistent to remove the STR even though they can’t use it. Rather, I consider it a racial trait: +6 STR for being a bipedal droid. That frees up some points to spend elsewhere where they desperately need it to remain relevant, bumping their DEX up to 17 and giving them some much-needed CON to stay in the fight.

They’re also short one feat, which I have chosen to resolve by removing Power Blast and giving them Improved Sniper Shot outright, a selection which is more consistent with their backstory.

Other oversights have also been corrected here, including restoring their base vitality to the amount it should be for a level 6 combat droid, and granting them the additional skill points they should’ve had at their level.

### Explanation
Wow a Jedi and an inflated stat line, where have I seen this before! The attribute inflation has been nixed; taken together, the reduction of these two attributes definitely makes them less powerful, but hopefully now non-Jedi companions will see more playtime. They DO at least gain some skill points which were due to them and never properly granted.
