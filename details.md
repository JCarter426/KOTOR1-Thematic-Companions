# Thematic KOTOR Companions

## Carth

### Statistics
|||
|-----|---------|
| STR | 13 → 14 |

### Feats
|||
|--------|------------------------------|
| Remove | Improved Two-Weapon Fighting |
| Add    | Implant Level 1              |

### Explanation
Carth’s setup is mostly consistent, save that he has two feats that could only be selected at level 4 (Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Weapon Specialization: Blaster Pistol). To remedy this I’ve chosen to give him a basic feat instead, removing Improved Two-Weapon Fighting in exchange for Implant Level 1. While mechanically Toughness would be the most optimal perk, Carth isn’t a frontline fighter (or at least hadn’t been to this point), and logically I reason he should have some level of neural interface as a starship captain.

## Mission

### Statistics
|||
|-----|---------|
| CHA | 10 → 13 |

### Explanation
Mission’s only problem was lacking base attributes she should have. She already has all the combat-related attributes I think she should for her age and experience, however, so the extra attributes are instead directed to CHA. She is Griff’s brother, after all—a real smooth-talker.

## Zaalbar

### Statistics
|||
|-----------------|---------|
| STR             | 20 → 18 |
| DEX             | 13 → 14 |
| CON             | 20 → 18 |
| WIS             | 12 → 11 |
| Vitality (base) | 32 → 24 |

### Feats
|||
|--------|-----------|
| Add    | Toughness |

### Explanation
Zaalbar’s statline is heavily inflated, but much like what I do with Hanharr in KOTOR 2, I consider this part of a racial bonus: +2 STR/+2 CON for being a Wookiee, with the tradeoff being that chest armor can’t be equipped.

Pulling Zaalbar’s STR and CON down to 16 (18 with the assumed racial bonus factored) gets him to a normal statline for a level 4 scout, but one point of WIS is traded for DEX, for thematic consistency—Zaalbar isn’t the brightest, after all, if he can be talked into the idea that slavery is a good idea by the brother he tried to kill over it years ago, and in the span of an afternoon at that.

Zalbaar is also short one feat (he receives Wookiee Toughness for free, but loses two armor feats he should be due since, as a Wookiee, he can’t wear armor), which I have chosen to spend on the mechanically optimal Toughness. This is somewhat offset, however, by bringing his base vitality down to where it should be, from 32 to 24; he’s already very strong, especially now coming with Toughness, and he doesn’t need the additional vitality to make him viable, especially when his CON is already so high.

## Bastila

### Statistics
|||
|-----|---------|
| DEX | 18 → 16 |
| CHA | 15 → 14 |

### Skills
|||
|--------------|-------|
| Stealth      | 0 → 1 |
| Awareness    | 4 → 5 |
| Treat Injury | 4 → 5 |

### Explanation
Bastila’s inflated attributes are pulled down to a standard position for a level 3 Sentinel, but in exchange she gets some skill points she should’ve had at that level, but lacked.

TECHNICALLY she has one more power and feat than she should, but there are good reasons for that. The power is Affect Mind, which no companion can use (but which is given to them for consistency, for when they use it in dialogues); in Thematic KOTOR Companions the Jedi companions are left with Affect Mind, but it is not counted against their power total. The feat is Battle Meditation, which is what makes Bastila so unique and sets her above someone else on her same level, and is treated as being a unique property of the character rather than a class oversight.

## T3-M4
|||
|-------------|-------|
| Demolitions | 1 → 3 |

### Explanation
T3’s stats are ludicrously overtuned, but much like G0-T0 in KOTOR 2, there’s no reason to make what is already the least-used companion used even less. To that end I have left him as-is, and indeed buffed his demolitions slightly, since with his currently insane 20 INT he should actually have had significantly more skill points. I have not invested the full amount he is due, though, so the player still has some measure of skill points to spend during level-ups.

## Canderous

### Statistics
|||
|-----|---------|
| STR | 15 → 16 |
| CON | 14 → 15 |

### Feats
|||
|--------|----------------------|
| Remove | Improved Power Blast |
| Add    | Implant Level 1      |

### Explanation
Canderous is mostly fine, though he’s 2 attribute points short (3 counting his level 4 point which he’s not granted by the time he becomes a party member). I’ve made him stronger and tougher, to further emphasize how he claims he’s older and less robust in KOTOR 2.

Additionally, his Improved Power Blast has been swapped for Implant Lvl. 1, since the game establishes he comes with implants already. Doesn’t make sense for him to have no ability to use them when he already has them!

## Juhani

### Statistics
|||
|-----|---------|
| INT | 14 → 10 |
| WIS | 12 → 10 |
| CHA | 13 → 14 |

### Skills
|||
|--------------|-------|
| Stealth      | 5 → 3 |
| Awareness    | 8 → 1 |
| Treat Injury | 8 → 2 |

### Explanation
Juhani, like all Jedi companions in KOTOR, is quite overtuned. To make up the attribute debt I’ve taken away a decent amount of her INT and WIS to represent her inner turmoil and self-questioning, as well as the obvious foibles she makes. To slightly compensate for this, her CHA is increased with the remainder, given her a +1 there.

Her stats have also been hit hard due to her INT reduction, but there is still potential here through level-ups, if the points are directed in the right way.
As with Bastila, Juhani after this rework still technically has one more feat than she should, but this feat is Force Camouflage, which is a unique feat for Juhani representing her upbringing and how she uses the Force. Since this is a unique feat which represents something Juhani already has, I have chosen not to count it against her feat total.

## HK-47

### Statistics
|||
|-----------------|---------|
| DEX             | 14 → 17 |
| CON             | 10 → 14 |
| Vitality (base) | 60 → 72 |

### Skills
|||
|--------------|-------|
| Computer Use | 0 → 3 |
| Security     | 0 → 3 |

### Feats
|||
|--------|----------------------|
| Remove | Power Blast          |
| Add    | Sniper Shot          |
| Add    | Improved Sniper Shot |

### Explanation
Forget his frequent disassembly, in both games HK just seems to have some structural issues. In KOTOR there are a few problems, but the biggest one is the most obvious: a droid that literally can’t use melee has 16 STR. 10 attribute points—9 if you’re being generous and counting the point he gets at level 4—blown on an entirely useless attribute.

Now, droids are probably stronger than humans, and I don’t think it’s right to remove the STR even though HK can’t use it. Rather, borrowing from Zaalbar, I consider it a racial trait: +6 STR for bipedal combat droid classes. That frees up some points to spend elsewhere where HK desperately needs it to remain relevant, bumping his DEX up to 17 and giving him some much-needed CON to stay in the fight.

He's also short one feat, which I have chosen to resolve by removing Power Blast and giving him Improved Sniper Shot outright. That’s much more consistent with his nature as an assassin droid than Power Blast.

Other oversights have also been corrected here, including restoring his base vitality to the amount it should be for a level 6 combat droid, and granting him the additional skill points he should’ve had at his level.

## Jolee

### Statistics
|||
|-----|---------|
| DEX | 16 → 14 |
| CHA | 15 → 12 |

### Skills
|||
|--------------|-------|
| Awareness    | 5 → 6 |
| Treat Injury | 4 → 7 |

### Explanation
Wow a Jedi and an inflated stat line, where have I seen this before! Jolee is an older fellow and his bones ache a bit, so he’s lost some DEX. The quirky old man thing doesn’t really sell with crowds as well as it did in 2003 either, so CHA has come down. Together, this definitely makes Jolee less powerful, but that says something about how much his attributes were boosted above what they should be; hopefully, between all the Jedi nerfs here, non-Jedi companions will see more playtime.

He DOES at least gain some skill points which were due to him and never properly granted.
